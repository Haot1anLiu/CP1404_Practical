# CP1404 Practicals

My name is Haotian Liu. And I'm a Python beginner.

## 3 main lessons I have learned about "clean code"

- Use appropriate naming: Give variables, functions, classes, and modules a meaningful name that can clearly express their purpose and function and improve the readability of the code.
- Comment code: Use comments in the code to explain the intent, algorithm, and important details of the code to help others understand and maintain the code.
- Use functions and modularization: Divide the code into smaller functions and modules, each function and module only focuses on a specific task, improving the maintainability and reusability of the code.
