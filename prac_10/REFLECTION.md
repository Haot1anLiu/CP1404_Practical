# Practical 10 Reflections

## Accuracy of Estimates
Throughout the course, I've made various estimates for completing practical tasks. Initially, my accuracy wasn't very high as I was still getting accustomed to the complexity and time requirements of the tasks. However, as the course progressed, I noticed a significant improvement in my ability to estimate how long a task would take. This improvement can be attributed to a better understanding of the subject matter and more experience with similar tasks.

## Learning from Code Reviews
Participating in code reviews, both as a reviewer and as a reviewee, has been a highly educational experience. 

### Being Reviewed
When my code was reviewed, I learned to appreciate the value of different perspectives. Reviewers often pointed out optimizations or alternative methods I hadn't considered, which broadened my problem-solving skills.

### Doing Reviews
On the other hand, reviewing others' code helped me reinforce my own understanding and identify common pitfalls in coding. It also encouraged me to stay updated with best practices and to think critically about code structure and readability.

## Thoughts on Practical Tasks
If I were in charge of the subject, one change I would implement would be to include more real-world case studies in the practical tasks. This would help bridge the gap between theory and real-world application, providing a more comprehensive learning experience.

## Code Review Contributions

1. [PR Review on Task XYZ](#) - In this review, I provided insights on optimizing a function for better performance.
2. [PR Feedback on Task ABC](#) - Here, I suggested improvements for code readability and structure.
